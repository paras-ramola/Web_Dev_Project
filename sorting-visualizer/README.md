### Algorithms Implemented

Bubble Sort: Repeatedly compares and swaps adjacent elements.

Selection Sort: Selects the minimum element and places it in correct position.

Insertion Sort: Builds a sorted portion one element at a time.

Merge Sort: Divide and conquer algorithm that merges sorted halves.

Quick Sort: Uses partitioning and recursion to sort efficiently.
